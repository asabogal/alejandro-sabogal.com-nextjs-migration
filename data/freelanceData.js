    description: "Kon-Tiki is a one of a kind restaurant and bar in Greenport, NY. They asked for a simple, mobile friendly website that was custom made to their needs. My approach to this design was mobile-first and minimalistic. The core of this project however, lies on the back end Admin Dashboard App. They needed an Admin control center to manage their guest reservations and menus. For this, I created an Express server and utilized MongoDB to manage the Admin authentication, the guest reservations system, and menu databases.",
